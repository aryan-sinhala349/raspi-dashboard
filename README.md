# Raspi-Dashboard
Raspi-Dashboard is a Raspberry Pi based desk dashboard. 
The idea is to allow the user to send any arbitrary data between the Pi and a PC, allowing the Pi to display any relevant information or to control applications on the PC.
To facilitate this, a pseudo application framework will be developed, allowing for reusable UI and communication functions.
